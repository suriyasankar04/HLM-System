# HLM-System
A Hate Language Monitoring System using Machine Learning detects and flags offensive or harmful language in online platforms. It processes text through cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction (e.g., word embeddings). Using models like RNN, the system classifies content, enabling real-time monitoring to reduce toxic communication.
